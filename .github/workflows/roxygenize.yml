# The purpose of this action is to run `document()` of the roxygen2 package on each commit.
# If new documentation was generated, it will automatically add a commit to the current branch.
# This has the same effect as running `document()` locally, but
#  * ensures it cannot be forgotten
#  * saves setting up the development environment locally, which is especially useful for new contributors.
