\title{Deconvolute using BASE}
\usage{
deconvolute_base_algorithm(
  gene_expression_matrix,
  n_permutations = 10,
  log10 = TRUE,
  combine_cells = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gene_expression_matrix}{a m x n matrix with m genes and n samples. Data
should be TPM normalized and log10 scaled.}

\item{n_permutations}{the number of permutations of each sample expression
to generate. These are used to normalize the results.}

\item{log10}{logical. if TRUE, log10 transforms the expression matrix.}

\item{combine_cells}{logical. This method estimates several cell types (~180).
If TRUE (default), these are combined into 19 major immune-stromal cell types.}
}
\description{
Cell types obtained with this method can be further reduced with the
map_result_to_celltypes function, using 'DCQ' as the method
}
