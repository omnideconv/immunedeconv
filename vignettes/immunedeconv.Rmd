# Introduction
Methods like fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) or Immunohistochemistry
(IHC)-staining have been used as a gold standard to estimate the immune cell
content within a sample, however these methods are limited in their scalability
and by the availability of good antibodies against the cell type markers. High
throughput transcriptomic methods allow to get a transcriptional landscape in
the sample with a relatively small amount of material that can be extremely
limited in clinical settings (e.g. tumor biopsies), which led to high utility
of methods like RNA-seq and microarrays to characterize patient tumor samples.
However, RNA-seq does not provide a detailed information on a cellular
composition of a sample, which then has to be inferred using computational
techniques.

## Conceptual differences between the methods

Such methods can, in general, be classified in two categories:

 * Marker gene-based approaches and
 * deconvolution-based approaches.

```{r fig_deconvolution_concepts, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="*Fig by @Finotello2018.*"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/concepts_deconvolution.gif")
```

Marker gene based approaches (a) are based on a list of genes (signature), that are characteristic for a cell type. By looking at the expression values of signature genes, every cell type is quantified independently, either using the gene expression values directly (MCP-counter) or by performing a statistical test for enrichment of the signatures (xCell).

Deconvolution methods (b) formulate the problem as a system of equations that describe the gene expression of a sample as the weighted sum of the contributions of the different cell types.  By solving the inverse problem, cell type fractions can be inferred given a signature matrix and the mixed gene expression. This can be accomplished using $\nu$-Support Vector Regression (SVR) (CIBERSORT) constrained least square regression (quanTIseq, EPIC) or linear least square regression (TIMER).

For more information, check out the review by @Finotello2018.


# Run the deconvolution
## Input Data
The input data is a `gene` $\times$ `sample` gene expression
matrix. In general values should be

* TPM-normalized
* *not* log-transformed.

For xCell and MCP-counter this is not so important. xCell works on the ranks of
the gene expression only and MCP-counter sums up the gene expression values.

Rownames are expected to be HGNC gene symbols.
Instead of a matrix, *immunedeconv* also supports ExpressionSets ([see
below](#using-expressionsets)).


## Run a method
This package gives you easy access to these methods.
To run a method with default options, simply invoke

```r
immunedeconv::deconvolute(gene_expression_matrix, method)
```

where `gene_expression_matrix` is a matrix with genes in rows and samples in
columns. The rownames must be HGNC symbols and the colnames must be sample
names. The method can be one of

```
quantiseq
timer
cibersort
cibersort_abs
mcp_counter
xcell
epic
```

### Example
For this example, we use a dataset of four melanoma patients from @EPIC2017. 
```{r, message=FALSE}
res = deconvolute(immunedeconv::dataset_racle$expr_mat, "quantiseq")
knitr::kable(res, digits=2)
```

### special case: CIBERSORT
CIBERSORT is only freely available for academic users and could not be
directly included in this package. To use CIBERSORT with this package,
you need to register on the
[cibersort website](https://cibersort.stanford.edu/), obtain a license,
and download the CIBERSORT source code.

The source code package contains two files, that are required:

```
CIBERSORT.R
LM22.txt
```

Note the storage location of these files. When using `immunedeconv`, you need
to tell the package where it can find those files:

```r
library(immunedeconv)
set_cibersort_binary("/path/to/CIBERSORT.R")
set_cibersort_mat("/path/to/LM22.txt")
```

Afterwards, you can call

```r
deconvolute(your_mixture_matrix, "cibersort")   # or 'cibersort_abs'
```

as for any other method.


### special case: TIMER
TIMER uses indication-specific reference profiles. Therefore, you *must*
specify the tumor type when running TIMER:

```r
deconvolute(your_mixture_matrix, "timer",
            indications=c("SKCM", "SKCM", "BLCA"))
```

`indications` needs to be a vector that specifies an indication for each sample
(=column) in the mixture matrix. The indications supported by TIMER are

```{r}
immunedeconv::timer_available_cancers
```

What the abbreviations stand for is documented on the [TCGA wiki](https://gdc.cancer.gov/resources-tcga-users/tcga-code-tables/tcga-study-abbreviations).

### Using ExpressionSets
The [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/)
[ExpressionSet](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/Biobase/versions/2.32.0/topics/ExpressionSet)
is a convenient way to store a gene expression matrix with metadata for both
samples and genes in a single object.

`immunedeconv` supports the use of an ExpressionSet instead of a gene
expression matrix. In that case, `pData` requires a column that contains gene
symbols. Which one needs to be specified in the `deconvolute()` call:

```r
deconvolute(my_expression_set, "quantiseq", column = "<column name>")
```

# Cell-type re-mapping
To provide consistently named results independent of the method, we defined
a *controlled vocabulary* (CV) of cell-types and arranged them in a tree.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
cell_type_hierarchy = new.env()
with(cell_type_hierarchy, {
  tree = immunedeconv:::.get_cell_type_tree()
  SetGraphStyle(tree, rankdir = "LR")
  SetEdgeStyle(tree, arrowhead = "vee", color = "grey35", penwidth = 2)
  SetNodeStyle(tree, style = "filled,rounded", shape = "box", fillcolor = "GreenYellow",
              fontname = "helvetica", tooltip = GetDefaultTooltip, fontcolor="black")
  plot(tree)
})
```

For each method, each cell-type is mapped to a node in the tree.
If you are curious, it's all defined in [this excel
sheet](https://github.com/grst/immunedeconv/blob/master/inst/extdata/cell_type_mapping.xlsx).

This tree can be used to summarize scores along the tree. For instance,
quanTIseq provides scores for regulatory and non-regulatory CD4+ T cells independently, but you are
interested in the fraction of overall CD4+ T cells. In that case you can use
`map_result_to_celltypes` to sum up the scores:

```{r, message=FALSE}
res = deconvolute(immunedeconv::dataset_racle$expr_mat, "quantiseq") %>%
  map_result_to_celltypes(c("T cell CD4+"), "quantiseq")
knitr::kable(res, digits=2)
```

The algorithm is explained in detail in the methods section of @sturm2019.

# Interpretation of scores
In general, cell-type scores allow for the comparison (1) between samples, (2) between cell-types or (3) both. 
Between-sample comparisons allow to make statements such as *"In patient A, there are more CD8+ T cells than in patient B"*. 
Between-cell-type comparisons allow to make statements such as *"In a certain patient, there are more B cells than T cells"*.

### Methods that allow between-sample comparisons

* MCP-counter
* xCell
* TIMER

### Methods that allow between-cell-type comparisions

* CIBERSORT

### Methods that allow both

* EPIC
* quanTIseq
* CIBERSORT abs. mode

EPIC and quanTIseq are currently the only methods providing an absolute score,
i.e. a score that can be interpreted as a cell fraction. These methods
also provide an estimate for the amount of uncharacterized cells, i.e. cells for
that no signature exists. This measure often corresponds to the fraction of cancer cells in the sample. 

CIBERSORT abs., while allowing both between- and within-sample comparisons, generates
a score in arbitrary units. 




# FAQs
### Can I specify a custom signature matrix through immunedeconv?
No, currently not. The reason is that the methods are conceptually different.
Some are marker gene based and others deconvolution-based. CIBERSORT performs
feature-selection on the matrix while EPIC and quanTIseq don't. EPIC uses *all*
genes to estimate the inter-sample variance while quanTIseq uses marker genes
only. This is also being discussed in
[#15](https://github.com/grst/immunedeconv/issues/15).

You can, however, provide custom signatures for most individual methods (see
next question).

### I want to use a special feature of a method, but I cannot access it through the `deconvolute` function.
You can access each method individually through the `deconvolute_xxx` function.
Through these functions you can access all native features. See the [function
  reference](../reference/) for details.

If you believe that the feature is available across multiple methods and
should be added to the `deconvolute` interface, feel free to open an
[issue](https://github.com/grst/immunedeconv/issues) or pull request.
